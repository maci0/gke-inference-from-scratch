# Building a Production-Ready LLM Inference Platform on GKE from Scratch

## Introduction

You've built an LLM application that works great in development. Now you need to serve it at scale. Thousands of concurrent requests with sub-second latency. Your prototype ran on a single GPU, but your production model won't fit on one machine. Time for some real infrastructure work.

This series walks through building a production LLM inference platform on GKE from scratch. We'll cover everything you need: networking, GPU clusters, inference frameworks, routing, and optimization.

Tools like `cluster toolkit` and `xpk` can automate much of this, but understanding what's happening under the hood matters. When your cluster starts acting weird at 3 AM, you'll actually know how to debug it.

We'll start with `gcloud` commands to see what's happening at each step, then automate it with Terraform for production use. With each step we will also explore and explain some of the underlying technologies that make everything work.
